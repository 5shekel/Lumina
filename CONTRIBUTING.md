If you are here, thank you for your interest in contributing to Lumina!

## The goal

Lumina is designed to be simple. Using Lumina at it's most basic should always try to consist of writing three lines of code to create the camera, assign a delegate, and presenting it.

Since Xcode can now stub out the delegate methods for you, Lumina should make the developer feel as though getting a camera up and running was quick.

## Pull Requests

The `master` branch will be locked down at the publishing of this document. Please submit any feature requests or bug fixes as a pull request.

## Running locally

Clone this project, and open `Lumina.xcworkspace`. Running the sample application should work out of the box. Here, you can make changes to the framework.
